                        <h2>Featured Coffee</h2>
                        <p>A popular Italian coffee, cappuccino is an espresso-based java that originated from an
                            Austrian beverage called kapuziner. Derived from the dark hue of the robes of 17th-century
                            Kapuzin friars in Austria, kapuziner was composed of coffee, milk, sugar, and a dollop of
                            whipped cream on top.</p>
                        <p>What we now know as cappuccino was a creation of Italians in the
                            1900s, perfect for a quick caffeine boost.</p>
